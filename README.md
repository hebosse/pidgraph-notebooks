A collection of Jupyter notebooks with examples of querying different PID providers like [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), [ROR](https://ror.readme.io/), [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) and PID graphs like the [FREYA PID Graph](https://blog.datacite.org/powering-the-pid-graph/), [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/about) and [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/) for connected objects.

### Run notebooks
While GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks as static HTML files (not executable), 
you can use this link to launch the notebooks on Binder where you can execute and modify them:

### Background
In the joint project [TAPIR](https://projects.tib.eu/tapir/en/) (Partially Automated Persistent Identifier-based Reporting), partially automated procedures for research reporting are being tested in the context of university and non-university research. To this end, the question is being investigated : 

To what extent can the necessary data aggregation be carried out on the basis of openly available research information using persistent identifiers?
